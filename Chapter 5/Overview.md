# Chapter Summary
- Convnets are the best tool for attacking visual-classification problems.
- Convnets work by learning a hierarchy of modular patterns and concepts to represent the visual world.
- The representations they learn are easy to inspect—convnets are the opposite of black boxes!
- You’re now capable of training your own convnet from scratch to solve an image-classification problem.
- You understand how to use visual data augmentation to fight overfitting.
- You know how to use a pretrained convnet to do feature extraction and fine-tuning.
- You can generate visualizations of the filters learned by your convnets, as well as heatmaps of class activity.
